                    Hi! I am CryptoKingXavier, a software developer and educator. I am a CS Major Student with certifications in Technology, Innovations, and Education. I will be your instructor in this Web Development With Python & Javascript Course. <br>

                    This course is intended to dive more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, Javascript, and SQL using popular web frameworks like Django, React and Bootstrap. <br>

                    Topics like Database Design & Implementation, Scalability, Security, UI/UX will be covered though on a shallow note but to a great extent. Through hands-on projects, studemts would learn to write and use custom APIs, create interactive UIs, and of-course leverage cloud services like Github and Heroku. <br>

                    Students would at the end emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet. <br>

                    <h1 style="color: crimson;">What Does Web Programming Mean?</h1> <br>

                    Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. The most common languages used for Web programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just programming, which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server scripting, and database technology. <br>

                    Web programming can be briefly categorized into client and server coding. The client side needs programming related to accessing data from users and providing information. It also needs to ensure there are enough plug ins to enrich user experience in a graphic user interface, including security measures. <br>

                    1. To improve user experience and related functionalities on the client side, JavaScript is usually used. It is an excellent client-side platform for designing and implementing Web applications. <br>

                    2. HTML5 and CSS3 supports most of the client-side functionality provided by other application frameworks. <br>

                    The server side needs programming mostly related to data retrieval, security and performance. Some of the tools used here include ASP, Lotus Notes, PHP, Java and MySQL. There are certain tools/platforms that aid in both client- and server-side programming. Some examples of these are Opa and Tersus. <br>

                    Now with that being said, let's dive a little deeper into the technical aspects of¬† it <br>
                </div> <br>
                <div id="fourth">
                    <h1 style="color: crimson;">Who is a Web Developer?</h1> <br>

                    A web developer is at heart an interactive artist. They‚Äôre someone driven by a deep desire to create things. A web developer‚Äôs canvas is a user‚Äôs web browser. <br>

                    Much like how a curious child takes pleasure in making toys by joining LEGO blocks‚Äîand then experiences a similar joy in taking things apart to see how they‚Äôre made, a web developer‚Äôs job is to use the basic building blocks of the web (like HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to create something complex like a webpage. Don‚Äôt sweat it! We‚Äôll get into all of those terms soon. <br>

                    It is also the web developer‚Äôs job to diagnose problems in a website‚Äôs functionality, to understand how something works by reading the code behind it, and to make changes to fix any issues. That essentially makes web developers the physicians of the world wide web. When we talk about the world wide web, we‚Äôre mainly referring to websites and web applications. At this point, the curious aspiring developer in you might be wondering, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between the two?‚Äù <br>

                    Well, we‚Äôre glad you asked! A website is usually a simple page or a group of pages (the popular web comic site, xkcd, for example). However, modern websites are much more than that. Take Google Docs, for example. It has a nice interface that, once opened, looks very much like a desktop software like Microsoft Office. Such complex websites are often termed web applications. A web developer today is expected to know how to create and work with web applications. Having said that, most people use the terms interchangeably, so don‚Äôt get too hung up on the terminology! <br>

                <div id="fifth">
                    <h1 style="color: crimson;">Types of Web Developers</h1> <br>

                    There are different types of web developers who focus on different areas. These include: <br>

                    Frontend developers: Frontend developers implement web page designs using HTML and CSS. They make sure the website looks pretty on different devices, and that the forms and buttons work. <br>

                    Backend developers: Backend developers create the backbone of the web application. They write code logic that handles a user‚Äôs input (for example, what should happen when you click the signup button after filling in a form). <br>

                    Full stack developers: Full stack developers do bits of both backend and frontend. Depending on the problem at hand, they can switch cape ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and move stacks. You can learn more about the differences between frontend and backend development in this guide.
                    There are many other specific roles in web development, like system architects, AI, machine learning and security engineers. These roles require more specialized knowledge of one or more of the above types of development, so many professionals in these roles will start by gaining some general web development experience. <br>

                    Welcome to the first day of your web development short course, and congratulations on taking your first step towards becoming a full-fledged web developer! <br>

                    <h1 style="color: crimson;">Setting up your Developer Environment</h1> <br>

                    For this course, we‚Äôll need two tools that every web developer uses: <br>

                    A text editor to write code
                    A web browser to see what we‚Äôre building
                    While you can use any web browser or text editor, we recommend using Google Chrome and Sublime for this course. <br>

                    Google Chrome can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> <br>
                    Sublime Text can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime  Text 3</a> <br>
                    Like any good craftsperson, it‚Äôs important that you know and understand your tools. For that reason, let‚Äôs take a brief look at what we have so far. <br> <br>

                    Google Chrome <br>
                    Google Chrome is a web browser. You may or may not already be using Google Chrome for browsing the web. A web browser allows us to view webpages (similar to the one you‚Äôre reading this very text on). We‚Äôll use Google Chrome to view the results after writing and making changes to our code. <br> <br>

                    Sublime Text <br>
                    Sublime Text is a popular text editor. A text editor is a very aptly named piece of software; it helps us edit text. It is similar to the default text editor that comes preinstalled on Mac or Windows, but has additional features like code highlighting to enhance our coding and debugging experience. <br>

                    ‚ö†Ô∏è Watch out! Sublime Text is a paid software with an unlimited trial period. You‚Äôll occasionally see a dialog box popping up prompting you to pay for the software license. You can pay for it if you wish, but you don‚Äôt need to just for this course. <br>

                    This course is OS independent, meaning that you can follow it on Windows, Mac OS or Linux. <br> <br>

                    üòéPro tip: If you get stuck when installing Chrome or Sublime, or see any error messages, it is best to do a web search (try a Google or DuckDuckGo search) for the exact error message. It is likely that other people have had the same problem before us and a solution already exists. <br>

                    After downloading, install it according to the instructions you‚Äôll find on those websites. Once you‚Äôre done installing, you‚Äôre ready to move to the next section. <br><br>

                    We'll do some more practicals within the week! <br>
